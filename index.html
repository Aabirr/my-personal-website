                <p>Hi, I'm Aabir, a freelance web designer and developer passionate about tech and programming. I got into programming when i was a boy. I choose freelancing because it allow me work from home or anywhere and its interesting to meet new peoples and knowing them.
                    I love building custom coded website that is fast, secure, mobile responsive and SEO optimized.
                    What I found was that a lot of small businesses don't have the funds to spend thousands of dollars upfront on a new website. They were in a frustrating spot - they either can't afford a good website, and if they can they don't know who to trust to make something great. So I tweaked my business model to fit their needs. That's how I came up with my $0 down and $100 a month model. It's more manageable for a small business to handle and won't hurt their bank accounts.
